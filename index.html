            <p>My name is Brad Pitt. I am an actor from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now live in Los
                Angeles like every other actor.</p>

            <p>I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy and drama. I am known for
                playing
                charismatic male leads, and have been described as the world's most attractive man by several media
                outlets.
                Nowadays I prefer subtler roles, including those where I play a father figure, which I am to my six
                children. </p>

            <p> Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with my own production company
                Plan B
                Entertainment, of which I am the CEO. In my spare time, I enjoy philantropy, architecture, and
                skateboarding. In my work with the Make It Right Foundation, I get to combine at least two of these
                interestsâ€”sometimes all three! </p>
